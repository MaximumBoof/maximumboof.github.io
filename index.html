				<h1> Agent Based Model </h1>
				<h2> Model details </h2>
					<p>Using python, an agent-based model has been created. This model is animated and sees a user defined number of agents move around an
					imported environment, where they are able to interact with each other and the environment.
					<p> Due to the web data scraping parts of the code, expect the model to take roughly 30 seconds for the figure window to open.
				<h2> Model features </h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A graphical user interface with spinboxes and buttons
						<li>User defined number of agents, number of iterations and neighbourhood size
						<li>Agents are able to interact with the environment and other agents
						<li>Animation of the model working
						<li>Feature's web data scraping for agent starting locations
						<li>A environment imported from a CSV file
						<li>The model is able to be restarted with different variables without having to reopen the window
					</ul>
